# Tricksy Battle Consolidation Project - Paulina Strunnikova
Hello, this program is currently unfinished. What it does is just the first bits of the tricksy battle card game, which is shuffling the deck of 48 cards, excluding the kings, and picking out 8 cards randomly for you. It creates a new round, it assigns the cards to player 1's hand, prints them out for you, and then prints them again when prompting you to pick a card. There is some time.sleep stuff incorporated into here to simulate the time shuffling and picking of cards. At the end, after the player inputs what card they want to play, it prints what card you chose and the exact time you played it, so that perhaps in a completed game with multiple players, you can keep track of who played what at which time. Make sure to run the whole file in your terminal, type this: python tricksy_battle_stru.py. Also, when typing in the card you want to play, make sure it is spelled and capitalized EXACTLY as how its listed in your hand, for you to be able to play it. This includes spaces and all. Happy playing!
